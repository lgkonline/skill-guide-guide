# Title and description

There are two important files for a Skill Guide. 
**skill-guide.json** is the config file, where you can set the title and the description of the guide. You also can enable different features.

The content of **README.md** will appear at the beginning of the guide. Here you can give a general introduction.
You can find information about the markdown syntax here: [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
